        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          When we first launched NESCAFÉ in Switzerland on 1 April 1938, it was
          predicted to be a huge success. But then WWII started in 1939. During
          the war, NESCAFÉ was a staple in the food rations of the US forces,
          and they loved it. Quick, easy and delicious coffee.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the war, NESCAFÉ was exported to France, Great Britain and the
          US, and the American troops became our brand ambassadors, spreading
          their love of NESCAFÉ. 
        </p>

        <p>
          During the rest of the 1940s, the popularity of NESCAFÉ grew. Today,
          NESCAFÉ is enjoyed in over 180 countries and has become the world’s
          favourite coffee..

        <h2>How Nescafé born</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          In 1929, Nestlé was challenged to help preserve the surplus coffee
          beans in Brazil that resulted from the Wall Street Crash. And Nestlé
          accepted the challenge. Our coffee specialist, Max Morgenthaler, was
          on a mission to create a delicious cup of coffee simply by adding
          water. Max and his team worked hard to find a new way to make instant
          coffee that would retain the coffee’s natural flavour. In 1938, they
          found the answer, and NESCAFÉ was born. Named by using the first three
          letters in Nestlé and suffixing it with ‘café’, NESCAFÉ became the new
          name in coffee
